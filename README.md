# KWM - Kris's Window Manager
KWM is a general-purpose GUI framework for OpenComputers. It uses GPU hardware buffers (available only on the [dev builds](https://ci.cil.li)) to achieve blazing fast performance.

## State
This is work in progress - there are bugs, updates will break the API, there are no docs - I wouldn't try to use it yet.
